# NTWK-2010-Network Computing 2 Course Repository

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course conforms to the second of three courses leading to the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) designation. The course expands on topics covered in Cisco Networking Level 1 and examines new topics. The course describes the architecture, components and operation of routers and switches in a small to medium business environment. Students will analyze, configure, verify and troubleshoot the following using both IPv4 / IPv6 protocols and services: Security, Redundancy, DHCP, WLAN, Static Routing, Inter-VLAN routing, Routing tables, Trunking, VLANs, STP and EtherChannel. By the end of this course, students will be able to recognize and correct common routing / switching issues. Basic procedural labs are introduced in each module. Students then perform basic configuration, implementation, and troubleshooting on provided equipment. Packet Tracer activities reinforce new concepts and allow students to model and analyze routing.
